# GlassThicknessSensor
This was a project for a subject in one of University task about measurement. 
The project was done with a calibration for the thickness of the glass with only flashlight from iPhone 7. 
After the calibration, the glass will be put to a dark box with only one source of light. 
This was done using Light Dependant Sensor (LDR) Sensor. 
The setup quite easy using only a glass with different thickness from 1mm to 30mm, and a dark box. Then a source of light (can be with laser or flashlight)
